QUANTITY	 	COMPONENT NAME
1	×	68B09 CPU
A Motorola or second source compatible 6809 CPU (this is not to be confused with the 6809E or EP )
4	×	SIP-9 (BUS Type) 10k Resistor networks
these tie each 10k path through pin 1
5	×	10k Resistor
5% or better 1/4 or 1/2 Watt Footprint uses 1/2 watt but they are not required
4	×	1k Resistor
5% or better, 1 is for optional power module mod, 2 for the optional serial card and may be omitted (1/2 or 1/4 Watt)
1	×	SN74HCT00N
Logic ICs / Gates and Inverters
1	×	SN74HCT138N
Logic ICs / Decoders, Encoders, Multiplexers, Demultiplexers
1	×	Tactile Push button
A 6x6 will fit, but you may have to splay the legs out a bit.
1	×	Latching DPDT switch
a 7x7 will fit, but you may have to splay the legs out a bit.
1	×	DC005 5.5x2.1mm Barrel Jack
Standard layout barrel jack, whatever fits your supply
1	×	LED 5mm
The Drop resistor is 1K which may need to be ajusted depending on your part but should be good enough for most standard 5mm leds
6	×	Sockets
Various sizes -- The EPROM Silkscreen and bypass cap are positioned for even a large ZIF socket if desired
1	×	Buck Converter Module
LM2596 DC to DC Converter module, optional if you intend to build your own power supply.
4	×	2.54mm 2x20 40-Pin Female Pin Header
Expansion slot connector
1	×	2.54mm 2x20 40-Pin Male Right Angle Header
For the Serial expansion card (if desired)
1	×	68B50 (6850 ACIA) Sierial Chip (highest speed grade)
For the Serial Expansion card (if desired)
6	×	100pF bypass capacitors
Regular Ceramic Disk is fine
1	×	4.7 uF Capacitor
I used an electrolytic, a tantalum or ceramic would be better.
8	×	47 uF Electrolytic capacitors
These are source caps for the card edge connectors. 10 or 25v fit well in this footprint.
1	×	1N4148 Diode
Silicon Switching diode
1	×	HB6809 PCB
Main PCB
1	×	HB6809 Minimal ACIA Serial Module PCB
optional, but required for serial output and highly recommended
1	×	62256 compatible SRAM
1	×	27128 compatible EEPROM / EPROM
I have not tested the AT28C16 16k EEPROM ​​ My guess is it will work, but if you are haveing trouble, an eeprom that is fully TTL compatible may be your best bet
1	×	7.3728 Mhz Crystal
2	×	22pf Ceramic disk capacitors
1	×	8 position dip switch
ACIA Adapter needs a dip switch block for picking which interrupt line to route the signal down.
